Problems with traditional IT approach 
1. Pay for the rent for the data center 
1. Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance 
1. Adding and replacing hardware takes time 
1. Scaling is limited 
1. Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure 
1. How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire…) 


What is Cloud Computing? 
1. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage,
applications, and other IT resources 
1. Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing 
1. You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need 
1. You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly 
1. Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services 
1. Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware 
required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need
via a web application. 


The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
1. On-demand self service: Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider 
1. Broad network access: Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms 
1. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources  
1. Rapid elasticity and scalability: Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.  Quickly and easily scale based on demand 
1. Measured service: Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used 


Six Advantages of Cloud Computing 
1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX) 
1. Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware 
1. Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX) 
1. Benefit from massive economies of scale 
1. Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale 
1. Stop guessing capacity 
1. Scale based on actual measured usage 
1. Increase speed and agility 
1. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
1. Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure 


Problems solved by the Cloud 
1. Flexibility: change resource types when needed 
1. Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use 
1. Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or
adding additional nodes 
1. Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed 
1. High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers 
1. Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
